Our event has a lot of ground to cover and we will be challenged for time. Hence we need you to do some pre-event homework.

Refer to the file IntroToErlang_PreEvent.pdf

page 2: Install Erlang on your laptop.
CAUTION: *Note that we are not responsible for what this may do to your laptop, so the use of a virtual machine such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is highly recommended.*
