Material for keyfunda's 'Intro to Erlang' event

Our event has a lot of ground to cover and we will be challenged for time. Hence we need you to do some pre-event homework. During the event we will quickly skip through the pre-event material.

Pick up the file IntroToErlang_PreEvent.pdf and study it. You should visit some of the linked web pages and try to familiarize yourself with the concepts. Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately, some of these are difficult concepts. At the least when we talk about this stuff during the event, it won't be totally new to you.
