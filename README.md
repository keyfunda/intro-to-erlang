Material for keyfunda's 'Intro to Erlang' event

Our event has a lot of ground to cover and we will be challenged for time. Hence we need you to do some pre-event homework.

Pick up the file [IntroToErlang_PreEvent.pdf](https://github.com/keyfunda/intro-to-erlang/blob/master/IntroToErlang_PreEvent.pdf?raw=true) in this repository and study it.

You should visit some of the web page links and try to familiarize yourself with the concepts. During the event we will *quickly* skip through the pre-event material.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately, some of these are difficult concepts. At the least, when we talk about this stuff during the event, it won't be totally new to you. You are always welcome to discuss any of this material during the breaks between sessions.

2) Page 8: Moore's Law of transistor scaling, and the power-wall for multicore processors. Please take time to read through our [blog post on semiconductor scaling](http://www.keyfunda.com/blog/2014/9/17/semiconductor-scaling-and-concurrent-clouds-part-i) at the keyfunda website.

3) Page 9: Concurrency vs Parallelism. This is an important distinction, you will benefit by reading [Rob Pike's lecture](http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism) and watching the video.

4) Page 14: Multi-core concurrency. You can quickly flip through our blog post on [concurrent clouds](http://www.keyfunda.com/blog/2014/9/23/semiconductor-scaling-and-concurrent-clouds-part-ii).

Get to work :-)
